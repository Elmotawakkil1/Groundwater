The contain measurements related to groundwater levels in the Rabat-Kenitra region

Purpose of the Dataset
This dataset seems to be designed for reproducibility purposes, allowing other researchers to replicate the study on groundwater levels in the Rabat-Kenitra region. By providing data on various environmental factors such as soil moisture, precipitation, and potentially temperature and NDVI (once the 'NULL' values are handled), the dataset aims to facilitate the development and validation of predictive models for groundwater levels.

Next Steps
Data Cleaning: Address the 'NULL' values by either imputing them with appropriate values or removing those rows/columns if they are not critical.
Feature Engineering: Create additional features if needed to improve model accuracy.
Model Training: Use this cleaned dataset to train machine learning models to predict groundwater levels based on the environmental factors provided.
